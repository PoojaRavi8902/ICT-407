    <h2>1. Introduction to Web Authoring</h2>

    <h3>1.1 What is Web Authoring?</h3>

    <p>
        Web authoring is the process of <strong>planning, designing, creating, and maintaining websites</strong>.
        It involves using specialised languages and tools to produce web pages that can be viewed using a web browser.
        In the Cambridge IGCSE ICT (0983) syllabus, web authoring focuses specifically on the use of
        <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> and
        <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Web authoring is <strong>not programming</strong>. HTML and CSS do not perform calculations or logic.
        Instead, they describe:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>What content appears on a webpage</li>
        <li>How that content is structured</li>
        <li>How that content is presented to the user</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In the IGCSE examination, students are assessed on their ability to create web pages that are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Technically correct</li>
        <li>Well-structured</li>
        <li>Visually clear</li>
        <li>Accessible to users</li>
        <li>Fit for a stated purpose and target audience</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Why Web Authoring is Assessed in IGCSE ICT</h3>

    <p>
        Web authoring is included in the IGCSE ICT syllabus because it tests a wide range of ICT skills, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Understanding of file management and folder structures</li>
        <li>Ability to follow detailed instructions accurately</li>
        <li>Application of design principles</li>
        <li>Awareness of usability and accessibility issues</li>
        <li>Attention to detail and problem-solving</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Unlike theory-only topics, web authoring allows candidates to demonstrate practical competence.
        This is why it forms a significant part of <strong>Paper 2 (Practical Examination)</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 How Web Authoring is Assessed</h3>

    <p>
        Web authoring skills are assessed in two main ways:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Theory questions</strong> – where candidates explain concepts such as usability,
            accessibility, or the purpose of HTML and CSS.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Practical tasks</strong> – where candidates must create, edit, or debug web pages
            using HTML and CSS.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        In the practical exam, candidates are typically given:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A scenario (for example, a school website or event website)</li>
        <li>A set of instructions</li>
        <li>Existing files and folders</li>
        <li>Images and resources</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Marks are awarded for following instructions precisely.
        Extra features that are not requested <strong>do not gain extra marks</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>1.4 Key Web Authoring Technologies in the Syllabus</h3>

    <h4>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h4>

    <p>
        HTML is used to create the <strong>structure</strong> of a webpage.
        It uses elements (also called tags) to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and forms.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML tells the browser:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>This is a heading</li>
        <li>This is a paragraph</li>
        <li>This is an image</li>
        <li>This is a link</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h4>

    <p>
        CSS is used to control the <strong>presentation</strong> of a webpage.
        It defines colours, fonts, spacing, layout, and positioning.
    </p>

    <p>
        CSS allows designers to separate content from presentation, which makes websites:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Easier to update</li>
        <li>More consistent</li>
        <li>More professional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.5 Websites, Web Pages, and Home Pages</h3>

    <p>
        It is important to understand the difference between key terms:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Website</strong> – a collection of related web pages stored together
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web page</strong> – a single HTML document
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Home page</strong> – the main or starting page of a website, usually named <code>index.html</code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In exams, incorrect use of terminology can lead to lost marks.
        Always use terms precisely.
    </p>

    <h3>1.6 Examiner Advice (Very Important)</h3>

    <p>
        According to examiner reports, common weaknesses include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Confusing HTML with CSS</li>
        <li>Using incorrect tags</li>
        <li>Ignoring accessibility</li>
        <li>Not following file structure instructions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Successful candidates:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use correct HTML structure</li>
        <li>Link external CSS correctly</li>
        <li>Test their work carefully</li>
        <li>Read every instruction slowly and carefully</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Website Purpose, Target Audience and Design Considerations</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Purpose of a Website</h3>

    <p>
        Every website is created for a <strong>specific purpose</strong>.
        In the Cambridge IGCSE ICT 0983 syllabus, students are expected to understand
        how the purpose of a website affects its design, content, and structure.
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of a website explains <strong>why the website exists</strong>.
        A website that does not clearly meet its purpose will be considered poorly designed,
        even if it is technically correct.
    </p>

    <h4>Common Website Purposes</h4>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Informational</td>
            <td>Provides information to users</td>
            <td>School or government website</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Educational</td>
            <td>Teaches or trains users</td>
            <td>Online learning platform</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Commercial</td>
            <td>Sells products or services</td>
            <td>Online shop</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Promotional</td>
            <td>Advertises an event or organisation</td>
            <td>Event website</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Entertainment</td>
            <td>Amuses or engages users</td>
            <td>Game or media website</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        In the examination, candidates are often given a scenario that clearly states the purpose
        of the website. All design decisions must support that purpose.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Target Audience</h3>

    <p>
        The <strong>target audience</strong> is the group of people the website is designed for.
        Identifying the target audience is essential because different users have different needs,
        abilities, and expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
        A website that is suitable for one audience may be completely unsuitable for another.
        Examiners expect candidates to recognise this and design accordingly.
    </p>

    <h4>Examples of Target Audiences</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Children</li>
        <li>Teenagers</li>
        <li>Adults</li>
        <li>Elderly users</li>
        <li>Professionals</li>
        <li>General public</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 How Target Audience Affects Website Design</h3>

    <p>
        When designing a website, the following features are directly influenced by the target audience:
    </p>

    <h4>Language and Tone</h4>

    <p>
        Websites for children should use simple language and short sentences.
        Websites for professionals may use formal language and technical terms.
    </p>

    <h4>Font Size and Type</h4>

    <p>
        Elderly users often require:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Larger font sizes</li>
        <li>Clear, simple fonts</li>
        <li>High contrast between text and background</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Teenagers may prefer modern fonts and visually engaging layouts.
    </p>

    <h4>Colour Choices</h4>

    <p>
        Colour choices must be appropriate for both the audience and the purpose.
        Bright colours may be suitable for children, but not for a professional business website.
    </p>

    <h4>Navigation Style</h4>

    <p>
        Younger or less experienced users benefit from:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Simple navigation menus</li>
        <li>Clear labels</li>
        <li>Fewer menu options</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Complex navigation structures can confuse users and reduce usability.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 Design Considerations in Web Authoring</h3>

    <p>
        Design considerations are the factors a web author must think about before and during
        the creation of a website.
    </p>

    <h4>Consistency</h4>

    <p>
        Consistency means that the website looks and behaves in the same way across all pages.
        This includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Navigation menus in the same position</li>
        <li>Same colour scheme</li>
        <li>Same font styles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Consistency improves usability and reduces confusion.
    </p>

    <h4>Readability</h4>

    <p>
        Readability refers to how easy it is to read text on a website.
        Factors that affect readability include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Font size</li>
        <li>Font type</li>
        <li>Line spacing</li>
        <li>Colour contrast</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>White Space</h4>

    <p>
        White space is the empty space between elements on a webpage.
        It helps to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Separate content</li>
        <li>Improve readability</li>
        <li>Make pages look less crowded</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.5 Usability and User Experience</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Usability</strong> measures how easy a website is to use.
        A usable website allows users to complete tasks quickly and without frustration.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the IGCSE exam, candidates are often asked to explain how design choices
        improve usability.
    </p>

    <h4>Features of a Usable Website</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Clear navigation</li>
        <li>Logical layout</li>
        <li>Readable text</li>
        <li>Consistent design</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.6 Accessibility Considerations</h3>

    <p>
        Accessibility ensures that websites can be used by people with disabilities.
        This is a <strong>core theory requirement</strong> in the IGCSE ICT syllabus.
    </p>

    <h4>Common Accessibility Features</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Alt text for images</li>
        <li>Labels for form fields</li>
        <li>High contrast colour schemes</li>
        <li>Simple and clear language</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In exam questions, candidates must link accessibility features to
        specific user needs.
    </p>

    <h3>2.7 Exam-Style Questions</h3>

    <h4>Short Answer Question</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> State one way the target audience affects website design.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Answer:</strong> The target audience affects the choice of font size and colour
        to ensure the website is easy to read.
    </p>

    <h4>Structured Question</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> Explain two ways a website for elderly users should be designed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Answer:</strong><br>
        1. Large font sizes should be used so text is easy to read.<br>
        2. High contrast colours should be used to improve visibility.
    </p>

    <h3>2.8 Common Examiner Comments</h3>

    <p>
        Examiner reports frequently mention that candidates:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Describe design features without linking them to purpose or audience</li>
        <li>Give generic answers that lack explanation</li>
        <li>Forget to mention accessibility</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        High-scoring answers always:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Refer to the target audience</li>
        <li>Link design choices to user needs</li>
        <li>Use correct terminology</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. HTML Fundamentals: Structure, Tags, Syntax and Examiner Pitfalls</h2>

    <h3>3.1 What is HTML?</h3>

    <p>
        HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>.
        It is the standard language used to create web pages.
        HTML is not a programming language; it is a <strong>markup language</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        A markup language uses tags to describe the structure and meaning of content.
        HTML tells a web browser how different parts of a webpage should be displayed,
        but it does not control detailed appearance such as colours or fonts.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Cambridge IGCSE ICT 0983, candidates are expected to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use correct HTML syntax</li>
        <li>Choose appropriate tags for content</li>
        <li>Structure web pages logically</li>
        <li>Avoid deprecated or incorrect tags</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 HTML Tags and Elements</h3>

    <p>
        An HTML <strong>tag</strong> is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets,
        for example <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.
        An HTML <strong>element</strong> usually consists of:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>An opening tag</li>
        <li>Content</li>
        <li>A closing tag</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Example:
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Some elements are <strong>empty elements</strong> and do not have a closing tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example:
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;img src="photo.jpg" alt="A photograph"&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>3.3 Basic HTML Document Structure</h3>

    <p>
        Every HTML document should follow a standard structure.
        Failure to include this structure often results in lost marks in the practical exam.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Main Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main content goes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Explanation of Each Part</h4>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Tag</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</td>
            <td>Declares the document as HTML5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;html&gt;</td>
            <td>Root element of the webpage</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;head&gt;</td>
            <td>Contains metadata and settings</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;title&gt;</td>
            <td>Text shown in browser tab</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;body&gt;</td>
            <td>Visible page content</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>3.4 The &lt;head&gt; Section in Detail</h3>

    <p>
        The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section contains information about the webpage
        that is not displayed directly to the user.
    </p>

    <p>
        Common elements inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>&lt;title&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;meta&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;link&gt; (for CSS)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Content such as paragraphs, images, and headings should <strong>never</strong>
        be placed inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.
    </p>

    <h3>3.5 The &lt;body&gt; Section</h3>

    <p>
        The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section contains all content that users see
        when viewing the webpage in a browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        This includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Text</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Links</li>
        <li>Lists</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In the practical exam, most marks are awarded for work done inside the
        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section.
    </p>

    <h3>3.6 Headings in HTML</h3>

    <p>
        HTML provides six levels of headings:
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Main Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subheading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Section Heading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Subsection Heading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Smaller Heading&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Smallest Heading&lt;/h6&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Headings should be used in a <strong>logical hierarchy</strong>.
        The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag should be used for the main heading of the page,
        followed by <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Skipping heading levels (for example, using <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> followed by
        <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>) is poor practice and may affect accessibility.
    </p>

    <h3>3.7 Paragraphs and Line Breaks</h3>

    <p>
        Paragraphs are created using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        A line break can be created using the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag.
        This should be used sparingly.
    </p>

    <h3>3.8 Emphasis and Text Formatting</h3>

    <p>
        HTML provides tags for emphasising text:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> – strong importance</li>
        <li><code>&lt;em&gt;</code> – emphasis</li>
        <li><code>&lt;b&gt;</code> – bold (presentation only)</li>
        <li><code>&lt;i&gt;</code> – italic (presentation only)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In IGCSE ICT, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> are preferred
        because they have semantic meaning.
    </p>

    <h3>3.9 HTML Comments</h3>

    <p>
        Comments are used to explain code and are not displayed in the browser.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Comments can help examiners understand your work, especially in complex tasks.
    </p>

    <h3>3.10 Common HTML Errors (Examiner Reports)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Missing closing tags</li>
        <li>Incorrect nesting of elements</li>
        <li>Content placed outside the &lt;body&gt;</li>
        <li>Incorrect use of headings</li>
        <li>Spelling mistakes in tag names</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.11 Exam-Style Questions</h3>

    <h4>Multiple Choice</h4>

    <h2>4. Text, Images, Hyperlinks, Lists and Tables</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Presenting Text on a Web Page</h3>

    <p>
        Text is the most common type of content on a webpage.
        In Cambridge IGCSE ICT 0983, candidates are expected to use
        appropriate HTML tags to present text clearly and logically.
    </p>

    <p>
        Correct text presentation improves:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Readability</li>
        <li>Usability</li>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>Professional appearance</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Paragraphs</h4>

    <p>
        Paragraphs must be created using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.
        Each paragraph should represent a separate idea or topic.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Using multiple paragraphs instead of long blocks of text makes
        content easier to read and understand.
    </p>

    <h4>Line Breaks</h4>

    <p>
        The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag inserts a line break without starting a new paragraph.
        It should only be used where a line break is logically required, such as in addresses.
    </p>

    </pre>

    <h3>4.2 Images in Web Pages</h3>

    <p>
        Images are used to enhance visual appeal and support textual content.
        In the IGCSE practical exam, images must be inserted correctly
        and stored in the correct folder.
    </p>

    <h4>The &lt;img&gt; Tag</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;img src="images/school.jpg" alt="Front of the school building"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is an empty element and does not have a closing tag.
    </p>

    <h4>Image Attributes</h4>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>src</td>
            <td>Specifies the location of the image file</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>alt</td>
            <td>Provides alternative text for accessibility</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>width / height</td>
            <td>Controls image size (better done with CSS)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        The <strong>alt attribute is compulsory</strong> in the IGCSE exam.
        Missing alt text is a very common reason for losing marks.
    </p>

    <h4>Image File Formats</h4>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Format</th>
            <th>Features</th>
            <th>Typical Use</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>JPEG (JPG)</td>
            <td>Small file size, lossy compression</td>
            <td>Photographs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>PNG</td>
            <td>High quality, supports transparency</td>
            <td>Logos, icons</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GIF</td>
            <td>Limited colours, supports animation</td>
            <td>Simple animations</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>4.3 File Paths for Images (Very Important)</h3>

    <p>
        In the practical exam, images are usually stored in a separate folder.
        Correct use of <strong>relative file paths</strong> is essential.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;img src="images/logo.png" alt="Company logo"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Common errors include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Incorrect folder name</li>
        <li>Missing file extension</li>
        <li>Incorrect use of upper and lower case</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.4 Hyperlinks (Links)</h3>

    <p>
        Hyperlinks allow users to navigate between web pages or visit external websites.
        They are created using the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>

    <h4>Internal Links</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Internal links connect pages within the same website.
        All internal links must be tested before submission.
    </p>

    <h4>External Links</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        External links connect to websites outside your own site.
    </p>

    <h4>Email Links</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;a href="mailto:info@school.org"&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Opening Links in a New Tab</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank"&gt;Visit Website&lt;/a&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Opening links in a new tab is usually appropriate for external websites.
    </p>

    <h3>4.5 Lists</h3>

    <p>
        Lists are used to organise information clearly.
        There are two main types of lists in HTML.
    </p>

    <h4>Unordered Lists</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Ordered Lists</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Plan the website&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Create HTML&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Apply CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Nested Lists</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Frontend
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Nested lists are commonly used in navigation menus and structured content.
    </p>

    <h3>4.6 Tables</h3>

    <p>
        Tables are used to display structured data.
        They must not be used for page layout.
    </p>

    <h4>Basic Table Structure</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Day&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Subject&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Monday&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;ICT&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Table Tags Explained</h4>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Tag</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;table&gt;</td>
            <td>Creates the table</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;tr&gt;</td>
            <td>Table row</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;th&gt;</td>
            <td>Header cell</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;td&gt;</td>
            <td>Data cell</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>4.7 Accessibility Considerations</h3>

    <p>
        All content elements must be accessible.
        This includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Alt text for images</li>
        <li>Clear link text (avoid “click here”)</li>
        <li>Proper table headers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.8 Common Examiner Errors</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Missing alt text</li>
        <li>Broken links</li>
        <li>Tables used for layout</li>
        <li>Incorrect file paths</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.9 Exam-Style Questions</h3>

    <h4>Multiple Choice</h4>

    <p>
        Which attribute is required to improve image accessibility?
    </p>

    <p>
        A. src<br>
        B. width<br>
        C. alt<br>
        D. height
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Correct answer:</strong> C
    </p>

    <h4>Structured Question</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> Explain two reasons why tables should not be used for page layout.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Answer:</strong><br>
        1. Tables make code harder to read and maintain.<br>
        2. Tables reduce accessibility and flexibility of layout design.

<section id="section5">
    <h2>5. File Organisation, Folder Structure and Relative Paths</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Importance of File Organisation in Web Authoring</h3>

    <p>
        File organisation refers to how files and folders are arranged within a website project.
        In Cambridge IGCSE ICT 0983, correct file organisation is essential because it directly affects
        whether images, stylesheets, and links work correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Examiner reports consistently highlight that many candidates lose marks due to
        poor file organisation rather than poor HTML or CSS knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Good file organisation:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Prevents broken links and missing images</li>
        <li>Makes websites easier to update and maintain</li>
        <li>Allows examiners to clearly understand your work</li>
        <li>Ensures portability of the website between computers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 Typical Website Folder Structure</h3>

    <p>
        In the practical exam, candidates are usually expected to use a clear and logical
        folder structure. A typical structure is shown below.
    </p>

    <pre>
website/
│
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
│
├── css/
│   └── style.css
│
└── images/
    ├── logo.png
    └── banner.jpg
    </pre>

    <p>
        This structure separates different types of files:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>HTML files in the root folder</li>
        <li>CSS files in a <code>css</code> folder</li>
        <li>Image files in an <code>images</code> folder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Naming Files and Folders</h3>

    <p>
        File and folder names must be chosen carefully.
        Incorrect naming is a common cause of broken links.
    </p>

    <h4>Rules for File Naming</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Use lowercase letters</li>
        <li>Avoid spaces (use hyphens if needed)</li>
        <li>Use meaningful names</li>
        <li>Include correct file extensions</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Good and Bad Examples</h4>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Good Practice</th>
            <th>Poor Practice</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>index.html</td>
            <td>Home Page.html</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>about.html</td>
            <td>AboutPage.HTML</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>style.css</td>
            <td>Style Sheet.css</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Some computer systems treat uppercase and lowercase letters as different.
        This means <code>Home.html</code> and <code>home.html</code> are not the same file.
    </p>

    <h3>5.4 Relative File Paths</h3>

    <p>
        A <strong>relative file path</strong> describes the location of a file
        relative to the current file.
        Relative paths are required in the IGCSE exam.
    </p>

    <h4>Linking a CSS File</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Linking an Image</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;img src="images/logo.png" alt="Company logo"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        These examples assume:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The HTML file is in the root folder</li>
        <li>The CSS file is in the <code>css</code> folder</li>
        <li>The image file is in the <code>images</code> folder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.5 Linking Between Pages Using Relative Paths</h3>

    <p>
        Internal hyperlinks must use relative paths to link between pages in the same website.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        If pages are stored in subfolders, the path must reflect this accurately.
    </p>

    <h4>Using Parent Folder Paths</h4>

    <p>
        The <code>..</code> symbol is used to move up one folder level.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;a href="../index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        This is often required when linking from a page inside a subfolder.
    </p>

    <h3>5.6 Absolute Paths (Why They Are Not Used)</h3>

    <p>
        An absolute path shows the full location of a file, including the drive letter
        or full web address.
    </p>

    <pre>
C:/Users/Student/Desktop/website/images/logo.png
    </pre>

    <p>
        Absolute paths must not be used in the practical exam because:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>They only work on one computer</li>
        <li>They break when files are moved</li>
        <li>They are not portable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Relative paths ensure the website works correctly on any computer.
    </p>

    <h3>5.7 Common File Organisation Errors (Examiner Reports)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Images stored in the wrong folder</li>
        <li>Incorrect file extensions</li>
        <li>Broken internal links</li>
        <li>Incorrect relative paths</li>
        <li>Using absolute paths</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.8 Practical Exam Tips</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Create folders before writing code</li>
        <li>Check file names carefully</li>
        <li>Test every link and image</li>
        <li>Save work frequently</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.9 Exam-Style Questions</h3>

    <h4>Short Answer</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> State one advantage of using relative file paths.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Answer:</strong> Relative paths allow the website to work correctly
        when moved to another computer.
    </p>

    <h4>Structured Question</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> Explain two problems caused by poor file organisation
        in a website.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Answer:</strong><br>
        1. Images may not display due to incorrect file paths.<br>
        2. Links between pages may not work, reducing usability.

    <h2>6. Forms: Input Types, Labels, Validation and Examiner Pitfalls</h2>

    <h3>6.1 Purpose of Forms in Web Authoring</h3>

    <p>
        Forms are used to <strong>collect data from users</strong>.
        In the Cambridge IGCSE ICT 0983 syllabus, candidates are not required
        to process or store form data using databases or scripting.
        Instead, the focus is on creating forms that are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Well-structured</li>
        <li>Easy to use</li>
        <li>Accessible</li>
        <li>Fit for the given scenario</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Forms are commonly used for:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Contact pages</li>
        <li>Registration forms</li>
        <li>Feedback surveys</li>
        <li>Event sign-up pages</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.2 Basic Form Structure</h3>

    <p>
        All form elements must be placed inside a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;form action="#" method="post"&gt;
    &lt;!-- form elements go here --&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Form Attributes Explained</h4>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>action</td>
            <td>Specifies where the form data is sent</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>method</td>
            <td>Specifies how data is sent (get or post)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        In the IGCSE exam, <code>action="#"</code> is acceptable unless
        otherwise stated in the question.
    </p>

    <h3>6.3 Text Input Fields</h3>

    <p>
        Text input fields are used to collect short pieces of text.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;input type="text" name="fullname"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Common uses include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Username</li>
        <li>City</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.4 Password Input</h3>

    <p>
        Password inputs hide the characters typed by the user.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;input type="password" name="password"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        This improves privacy but does not encrypt data.
    </p>

    <h3>6.5 Email Input</h3>

    <p>
        The email input type automatically checks for a valid email format.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;input type="email" name="email"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        This is preferred over text inputs when collecting email addresses.
    </p>

    <h3>6.6 Number Input</h3>

    <pre>
&lt;input type="number" name="age"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        This restricts input to numbers only.
    </p>

    <h3>6.7 Radio Buttons</h3>

    <p>
        Radio buttons are used when the user must select <strong>one option only</strong>.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"&gt; Male
&lt;input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"&gt; Female
    </pre>

    <p>
        All radio buttons in the same group must share the <code>name</code> attribute.
    </p>

    <h3>6.8 Checkboxes</h3>

    <p>
        Checkboxes allow users to select <strong>multiple options</strong>.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;input type="checkbox" name="subject" value="ict"&gt; ICT
&lt;input type="checkbox" name="subject" value="maths"&gt; Maths
    </pre>

    <h3>6.9 Drop-Down Lists (Select Menus)</h3>

    <pre>
&lt;select name="country"&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Norway&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;UK&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;India&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Drop-down lists save space and reduce input errors.
    </p>

    <h3>6.10 Text Areas</h3>

    <p>
        Text areas are used for long text input.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;textarea name="message"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>6.11 Labels and Accessibility</h3>

    <p>
        Labels are essential for accessibility and usability.
        Every input field should have a label.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;label for="email"&gt;Email Address:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="email" id="email"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Labels allow screen readers to correctly describe form fields.
    </p>

    <h3>6.12 Required Fields</h3>

    <p>
        The <code>required</code> attribute prevents form submission
        unless the field is completed.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;input type="text" required&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>6.13 Placeholder Text</h3>

    <pre>
&lt;input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Placeholder text provides guidance but does not replace labels.
    </p>

    <h3>6.14 Grouping Form Elements</h3>

    <p>
        The <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> tag groups related form elements.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;fieldset&gt;
    &lt;legend&gt;Personal Details&lt;/legend&gt;
    &lt;input type="text"&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>6.15 Submit and Reset Buttons</h3>

    <pre>
&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
&lt;input type="reset" value="Clear"&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>6.16 Common Examiner Errors (Forms)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Missing labels</li>
        <li>Incorrect input types</li>
        <li>Radio buttons with different names</li>
        <li>Missing required attributes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.17 Exam-Style Questions</h3>

    <h4>Multiple Choice</h4>

    <p>
        Which input type ensures that only one option can be selected?
    </p>

    <p>
        A. checkbox<br>
        B. text<br>
        C. radio<br>
        D. number
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Correct answer:</strong> C
    </p>

    <h2>7. CSS Fundamentals: Purpose, Selectors, Properties and Syntax</h2>

    <h3>7.1 What is CSS?</h3>

    <p>
        CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>.
        CSS is used to control the <strong>presentation</strong> of web pages.
        While HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines how that content looks.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Cambridge IGCSE ICT 0983, CSS is used to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Control colours</li>
        <li>Control fonts and text size</li>
        <li>Control spacing and alignment</li>
        <li>Create consistent design across multiple pages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        A key principle examined in IGCSE ICT is the <strong>separation of content and presentation</strong>.
        HTML should be used only for structure, while CSS should be used only for styling.
    </p>

    <h3>7.2 Advantages of Using CSS</h3>

    <p>
        CSS offers several important advantages over using HTML tags or attributes for styling.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Improves consistency across pages</li>
        <li>Makes websites easier to update</li>
        <li>Reduces repetition of code</li>
        <li>Improves accessibility</li>
        <li>Produces a more professional appearance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In theory questions, candidates are often asked to explain why CSS should be used instead of HTML.
        Answers must refer to maintenance, consistency, or separation of content and presentation.
    </p>

    <h3>7.3 Ways of Applying CSS</h3>

    <p>
        There are three ways to apply CSS to a webpage.
        All three may appear in exam questions, but one is clearly preferred.
    </p>

    <h4>7.3.1 Inline CSS</h4>

    <p>
        Inline CSS is written directly inside an HTML tag.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;p style="color: red;"&gt;This is red text.&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Disadvantages of inline CSS:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Not reusable</li>
        <li>Difficult to maintain</li>
        <li>Mixes content and presentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7.3.2 Internal CSS</h4>

    <p>
        Internal CSS is written inside a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the
        <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the HTML document.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        p {
            color: blue;
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Internal CSS applies to the entire page, but not to multiple pages.
    </p>

    <h4>7.3.3 External CSS (Best Practice)</h4>

    <p>
        External CSS is written in a separate file with a <code>.css</code> extension.
        This is the <strong>preferred method</strong> in the IGCSE practical exam.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Advantages of external CSS:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>One file controls many pages</li>
        <li>Consistent design</li>
        <li>Easier to maintain</li>
        <li>Cleaner HTML code</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.4 CSS Syntax</h3>

    <p>
        A CSS rule consists of a <strong>selector</strong> and a
        <strong>declaration block</strong>.
    </p>

    <pre>
selector {
    property: value;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        Example:
    </p>

    <pre>
p {
    color: black;
    font-size: 14px;
}
    </pre>

    <h3>7.5 CSS Selectors</h3>

    <p>
        CSS selectors determine which HTML elements a style rule applies to.
        In IGCSE ICT, three main types of selectors must be understood.
    </p>

    <h4>7.5.1 Element Selector</h4>

    <pre>
p {
    font-size: 16px;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        This applies the style to all paragraph elements.
    </p>

    <h4>7.5.2 Class Selector</h4>

    <pre>
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}
    </pre>

    <pre>
&lt;p class="highlight"&gt;Important text&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Class selectors are reusable and are commonly used in the exam.
    </p>

    <h4>7.5.3 ID Selector</h4>

    <pre>
#header {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
    </pre>

    <pre>
&lt;div id="header"&gt;Header content&lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        ID selectors must be unique on a page.
    </p>

    <h3>7.6 Common CSS Properties</h3>

    <h4>Text Colour</h4>

    <pre>
color: #000000;
    </pre>

    <h4>Background Colour</h4>

    <pre>
background-color: #f4f4f4;
    </pre>

    <h4>Font Family</h4>

    <pre>
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    </pre>

    <h4>Font Size</h4>

    <pre>
font-size: 16px;
    </pre>

    <h3>7.7 CSS Comments</h3>

    <pre>
/* This is a CSS comment */
    </pre>

    <p>
        Comments help explain code and improve readability.
    </p>

    <h3>7.8 Common CSS Errors (Examiner Reports)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Forgetting to link the external CSS file</li>
        <li>Missing semicolons</li>
        <li>Incorrect selectors</li>
        <li>Using inline CSS instead of external CSS</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.9 Exam-Style Questions</h3>

    <h4>Multiple Choice</h4>

    <p>
        Which type of CSS is preferred in the IGCSE practical exam?
    </p>

    <p>
        A. Inline<br>
        B. Internal<br>
        C. External<br>
        D. Embedded
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Correct answer:</strong> C
    </p>

    <h4>Structured Question</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> Explain two advantages of using external CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Answer:</strong><br>
        1. External CSS allows the same styles to be applied to multiple pages, ensuring consistency.<br>
        2. External CSS makes websites easier to maintain because changes only need to be made in one file.

    <h2>8. CSS Box Model, Page Layout Techniques and Structure</h2>

    <h3>8.1 Understanding Page Layout in Web Design</h3>

    <p>
        Page layout refers to how content is arranged on a web page.
        In Cambridge IGCSE ICT 0983, candidates are expected to create
        layouts that are clear, logical, and suitable for the given purpose
        and target audience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Layout is assessed mainly in the practical exam and is closely linked to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Usability</li>
        <li>Readability</li>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>Professional appearance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.2 The CSS Box Model (Very Important)</h3>

    <p>
        In CSS, every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box.
        This concept is known as the <strong>CSS Box Model</strong>.
        Understanding the box model is essential for controlling spacing and layout.
    </p>

    <h4>Components of the Box Model</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Content</strong> – the actual text or image</li>
        <li><strong>Padding</strong> – space between the content and the border</li>
        <li><strong>Border</strong> – the line surrounding the padding and content</li>
        <li><strong>Margin</strong> – space outside the border</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Visual Representation (Conceptual)</h4>

    <pre>
Margin
-------------------------
|       Border          |
|  -------------------  |
|  |     Padding     |  |
|  |  ------------   |  |
|  |  |  Content |   |  |
|  |  ------------   |  |
|  |                |  |
|  -------------------  |
-------------------------
    </pre>

    <h3>8.3 Padding</h3>

    <p>
        Padding controls the space <strong>inside</strong> an element,
        between the content and the border.
    </p>

    <pre>
p {
    padding: 10px;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        Padding increases the clickable area of elements and improves readability.
    </p>

    <h3>8.4 Margin</h3>

    <p>
        Margin controls the space <strong>outside</strong> an element,
        separating it from other elements.
    </p>

    <pre>
div {
    margin: 20px;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        Margins are commonly used to separate sections of a page.
    </p>

    <h3>8.5 Borders</h3>

    <p>
        Borders surround the padding and content of an element.
    </p>

    <pre>
div {
    border: 2px solid black;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        Borders are often used to visually group content.
    </p>

    <h3>8.6 Width and Height</h3>

    <p>
        The width and height properties control the size of elements.
    </p>

    <pre>
img {
    width: 300px;
    height: auto;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        Using <code>height: auto</code> helps maintain the correct image proportions.
    </p>

    <h3>8.7 Page Layout Using Div Elements</h3>

    <p>
        The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is a generic container
        used to group content for styling and layout.
    </p>

    <p>
        A simple page layout often includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Header</li>
        <li>Navigation</li>
        <li>Main content area</li>
        <li>Footer</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Basic Layout Structure (HTML)</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;div id="header"&gt;Header&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nav"&gt;Navigation&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="content"&gt;Main content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;Footer&lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Basic Layout Styling (CSS)</h4>

    <pre>
#header, #nav, #content, #footer {
    padding: 15px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}
    </pre>

    <h3>8.8 Fixed-Width and Fluid Layouts</h3>

    <h4>Fixed-Width Layout</h4>

    <p>
        A fixed-width layout uses a specific width value.
    </p>

    <pre>
#content {
    width: 960px;
    margin: auto;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        Fixed layouts are easy to control but do not adapt to screen size.
    </p>

    <h4>Fluid Layout</h4>

    <p>
        A fluid layout uses percentage widths.
    </p>

    <pre>
#content {
    width: 80%;
    margin: auto;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        Fluid layouts adjust to different screen sizes.
    </p>

    <h3>8.9 Clearing Common Layout Misconceptions</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Tables should not be used for layout</li>
        <li>Spacing should be controlled with CSS, not HTML</li>
        <li>Layout should support content, not distract from it</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.10 Examiner-Reported Layout Errors</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Overcrowded pages</li>
        <li>No spacing between sections</li>
        <li>Inconsistent layout across pages</li>
        <li>Poor alignment of elements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.11 Exam-Style Questions</h3>

    <h4>Multiple Choice</h4>

    <p>
        Which CSS property controls space outside an element?
    </p>

    <p>
        A. padding<br>
        B. margin<br>
        C. border<br>
        D. width
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Correct answer:</strong> B
    </p>

    <h4>Structured Question</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> Explain the difference between margin and padding.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Answer:</strong><br>
        Margin controls the space outside an element, separating it from other elements,
        while padding controls the space inside an element between the content and the border.

    <h2>9. Navigation Menus, Usability and Accessibility</h2>

    <h3>9.1 Purpose of Navigation in a Website</h3>

    <p>
        Navigation refers to the system of links that allows users to move
        between pages in a website.
        In Cambridge IGCSE ICT 0983, navigation is a critical feature because
        it directly affects <strong>usability</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        A website with poor navigation is difficult to use, even if the
        content itself is good.
        Examiners expect navigation to be:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Clear</li>
        <li>Consistent</li>
        <li>Easy to understand</li>
        <li>Present on all pages</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9.2 Types of Navigation</h3>

    <h4>Text-Based Navigation</h4>

    <p>
        Text-based navigation is the most common type used in the IGCSE exam.
        It is simple, accessible, and easy to implement.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a href="contact.html"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Text-based navigation works well for all users and devices.
    </p>

    <h4>List-Based Navigation</h4>

    <p>
        Navigation menus are often created using unordered lists.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="contact.html"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        This structure is especially suitable for styling with CSS.
    </p>

    <h3>9.3 Navigation Consistency</h3>

    <p>
        Consistent navigation means that the navigation menu:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Appears in the same position on every page</li>
        <li>Uses the same wording on every page</li>
        <li>Links to the same destinations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In the practical exam, marks are often lost when:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Navigation is missing on one or more pages</li>
        <li>Links point to incorrect files</li>
        <li>Different pages use different navigation menus</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9.4 Usability</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Usability</strong> measures how easy a website is to use.
        A usable website allows users to complete tasks quickly and without confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
        In theory questions, candidates are frequently asked to explain
        how specific design choices improve usability.
    </p>

    <h4>Key Usability Features</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Clear navigation</li>
        <li>Logical layout</li>
        <li>Readable text</li>
        <li>Consistent design</li>
        <li>Clear feedback to users</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9.5 Accessibility</h3>

    <p>
        Accessibility ensures that websites can be used by people with disabilities.
        This is a <strong>core theory requirement</strong> in Cambridge IGCSE ICT.
    </p>

    <p>
        Candidates must be able to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Identify accessibility features</li>
        <li>Explain how they help specific users</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Accessibility Features and Their Benefits</h4>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Who It Helps</th>
            <th>Why</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Alt text</td>
            <td>Visually impaired users</td>
            <td>Screen readers can describe images</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Labels</td>
            <td>Screen reader users</td>
            <td>Inputs are clearly identified</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>High contrast colours</td>
            <td>Users with poor vision</td>
            <td>Text is easier to read</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Simple language</td>
            <td>Cognitive disabilities</td>
            <td>Content is easier to understand</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>9.6 Designing for Accessibility in Navigation</h3>

    <p>
        Navigation should be:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Easy to read</li>
        <li>Easy to click</li>
        <li>Clearly labelled</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Avoid vague link text such as <em>Click here</em>.
        Instead, use meaningful link text such as <em>Contact Us</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>9.7 Common Examiner Errors</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Broken navigation links</li>
        <li>Navigation missing on some pages</li>
        <li>Poor contrast in navigation text</li>
        <li>Overcrowded menus</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9.8 Exam-Style Questions</h3>

    <h4>Short Answer</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> State one reason why consistent navigation is important.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Answer:</strong> Consistent navigation helps users find information
        easily on every page.
    </p>

    <h4>Structured Question</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> Explain two ways a website can be made accessible
        for visually impaired users.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Model Answer:</strong><br>
        1. Alt text can be added to images so screen readers can describe them.<br>
        2. High contrast colours can be used to make text easier to read.

<section id="section10">
    <h2>10. Testing, Debugging and Common Examiner Errors</h2>

    <h3>10.1 Importance of Testing in Web Authoring</h3>

    <p>
        Testing is the process of checking that a website works correctly
        before it is published or submitted.
        In Cambridge IGCSE ICT 0983, testing is essential because marks are only awarded
        for work that functions correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
        A website may look correct in the code editor but still contain errors
        that prevent it from working as intended.
        Candidates who do not test their work often lose marks unnecessarily.
    </p>

    <p>
        Testing should be carried out:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>After completing each task</li>
        <li>After making changes to code</li>
        <li>Before submitting the final work</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10.2 What Should Be Tested?</h3>

    <p>
        In the practical exam, candidates should test all aspects of the website, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>All internal and external links</li>
        <li>All images</li>
        <li>CSS styling</li>
        <li>Forms and validation</li>
        <li>Page layout and alignment</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10.3 Testing Hyperlinks</h3>

    <p>
        All hyperlinks must be clicked to ensure they lead to the correct destination.
        Broken links are one of the most common reasons for lost marks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Common causes of broken links include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Incorrect file names</li>
        <li>Incorrect file paths</li>
        <li>Missing file extensions</li>
        <li>Incorrect use of upper and lower case</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Example of an Incorrect Link</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;a href="Home.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Corrected Version</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;a href="home.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>10.4 Testing Images</h3>

    <p>
        Images should be checked to ensure they:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Display correctly</li>
        <li>Use the correct file path</li>
        <li>Have appropriate alt text</li>
        <li>Are sized correctly</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Common Image Errors</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Image stored in the wrong folder</li>
        <li>Incorrect file extension</li>
        <li>Missing alt attribute</li>
        <li>Distorted image due to incorrect sizing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10.5 Testing CSS</h3>

    <p>
        CSS should be tested to ensure that styles are applied as intended.
        A very common mistake is forgetting to link the external CSS file.
    </p>

    <h4>Checking the CSS Link</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        If CSS is not working, candidates should check:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The file path to the CSS file</li>
        <li>The file name and extension</li>
        <li>Spelling of selectors</li>
        <li>Missing semicolons or brackets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10.6 Debugging HTML Errors</h3>

    <p>
        Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code.
        HTML errors often cause content to display incorrectly or not at all.
    </p>

    <h4>Missing Closing Tags</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph
    </pre>

    <p>
        Correct version:
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <h4>Incorrect Nesting</h4>

    <pre>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        Correct version:
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>10.7 Debugging CSS Errors</h3>

    <h4>Missing Semicolon</h4>

    <pre>
p {
    color: red
    background-color: blue;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        Correct version:
    </p>

    <pre>
p {
    color: red;
    background-color: blue;
}
    </pre>

    <h4>Incorrect Selector</h4>

    <pre>
header {
    background-color: grey;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        If the HTML uses <code>id="header"</code>, the correct selector is:
    </p>

    <pre>
#header {
    background-color: grey;
}
    </pre>

    <h3>10.8 Testing Forms</h3>

    <p>
        Forms must be tested to ensure that:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>All required fields prevent submission when empty</li>
        <li>Radio buttons behave correctly</li>
        <li>Checkboxes allow multiple selections</li>
        <li>Email fields reject invalid input</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10.9 Examiner-Reported Mistakes</h3>

    <p>
        According to examiner reports, common reasons for losing marks include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Not testing work before submission</li>
        <li>Ignoring error messages</li>
        <li>Leaving broken links unfixed</li>
        <li>Failing to check form validation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10.10 Practical Exam Testing Checklist</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>All pages open correctly</li>
        <li>All links work</li>
        <li>All images display</li>
        <li>CSS is applied correctly</li>
        <li>Forms behave as expected</li>
        <li>No visible error messages</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10.11 Exam-Style Questions</h3>

    <h4>Short Answer</h4>

    <p>
