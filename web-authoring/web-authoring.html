  <h2>Student Pane – Web Authoring (IGCSE ICT)</h2>

  <h3>1. What is Web Authoring?</h3>
  <p>
    Web authoring is the process of designing and creating web pages that can be
    viewed using a web browser. In Cambridge IGCSE ICT, web authoring focuses on
    creating structured, well-designed, and accessible web pages using
    <strong>HTML</strong> for structure and <strong>CSS</strong> for presentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Students are assessed on their ability to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create valid HTML pages</li>
    <li>Apply external CSS stylesheets</li>
    <li>Use images, links, and navigation correctly</li>
    <li>Design pages suitable for a target audience</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Basic Structure of an HTML Webpage</h3>
  <p>
    Every HTML webpage must follow a clear structure. This structure helps
    browsers understand how to display the page and helps developers maintain
    the content easily.
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My Webpage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    The <strong>DOCTYPE</strong> declaration tells the browser that this page is
    written in HTML5. Missing or incorrect structure can lead to lost marks in
    practical examinations.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Common HTML Elements You Must Know</h3>
  <p>
    The following elements are frequently tested in both theory and practical
    examinations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</strong> – headings</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> – paragraphs</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;br&gt;</strong> – line breaks</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;</strong> – lists</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> – hyperlinks</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> – images</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Using Images Correctly</h3>
  <p>
    Images are added using the <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> tag. Every image must
    include alternative text using the <strong>alt</strong> attribute. This is
    essential for accessibility and is required for full marks.
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;img src="images/school.jpg" alt="Front view of the school building"&gt;
  </pre>

  <h3>5. Introduction to CSS</h3>
  <p>
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the appearance of a webpage. Cambridge
    IGCSE prefers the use of <strong>external CSS</strong> because it separates
    content from presentation and demonstrates good design practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    An external CSS file is linked using the following line inside the
    <strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong> section:
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
  </pre>

  <h3>6. Accessibility and Usability</h3>
  <p>
    A good webpage must be accessible to all users. This includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Clear navigation</li>
    <li>Readable font sizes</li>
    <li>Good colour contrast</li>
    <li>Alternative text for images</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Accessibility and usability are common theory questions in examinations.
  </p>

</section>

  </p>
    <h3>7. Hyperlinks and Navigation</h3>
  <p>
    Hyperlinks allow users to move between pages and sections of a website.
    In the Cambridge IGCSE ICT practical exam, students are often required to
    create navigation menus that link multiple pages together.
  </p>

  <p>
    A hyperlink is created using the <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> tag:
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    Links can also point to sections on the same page using IDs:
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;a href="#practice"&gt;Go to Practice Pane&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    Incorrect file paths are one of the most common reasons students lose marks
    in practical examinations.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Relative File Paths (Very Important)</h3>
  <p>
    A relative file path describes the location of a file in relation to the
    current file. Cambridge practical exams expect students to use relative
    paths correctly.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>style.css</strong> – file in the same folder</li>
    <li><strong>images/logo.png</strong> – image inside an images folder</li>
    <li><strong>../index.html</strong> – file one folder above</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Using incorrect paths will result in broken images or links, which leads
    to lost marks.
  </p>

  <h3>9. Using Lists Effectively</h3>
  <p>
    Lists are commonly used for navigation menus, instructions, and features.
    There are two main types of lists:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Unordered lists (<strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong>)</li>
    <li>Ordered lists (<strong>&lt;ol&gt;</strong>)</li>
  </ul>

  <pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  </pre>

  <h3>10. Good Page Layout and Consistency</h3>
  <p>
    A professional website uses a consistent layout across all pages. This
    means the header, navigation bar, and footer should appear in the same
    position on every page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consistency improves usability and is often mentioned in theory questions.
  </p>

  <h3>11. Testing a Webpage</h3>
  <p>
    Before submitting a webpage in an exam, students should always test their
    work carefully.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Check that all links work correctly</li>
    <li>Ensure images display properly</li>
    <li>Confirm CSS is linked correctly</li>
    <li>Check spelling and grammar</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Testing is an essential step and should be mentioned when answering theory
    questions about website development.
  </p>

  <h3>12. Common Exam Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Missing alternative text for images</li>
    <li>Incorrect file or folder names</li>
    <li>Using inline CSS instead of external CSS</li>
    <li>Poor colour contrast</li>
    <li>Ignoring client requirements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Avoiding these mistakes can significantly improve exam performance.
  </p>
  <h3>13. CSS Properties Commonly Tested in Exams</h3>
  <p>
    In Cambridge IGCSE ICT examinations, students are not expected to memorise
    every CSS property. However, there are several properties that appear
    frequently in both theory and practical tasks.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>color</strong> – sets the text colour</li>
    <li><strong>background-color</strong> – sets the background colour</li>
    <li><strong>font-family</strong> – changes the font type</li>
    <li><strong>font-size</strong> – changes the size of text</li>
    <li><strong>text-align</strong> – aligns text (left, center, right)</li>
    <li><strong>padding</strong> – space inside an element</li>
    <li><strong>margin</strong> – space outside an element</li>
  </ul>

  <pre>
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f4f6f8;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  text-align: center;
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    Using these properties correctly helps create a clear and professional
    layout and demonstrates good design practice.
  </p>

  <h3>14. Why External CSS Is Preferred</h3>
  <p>
    External CSS is written in a separate file and linked to the HTML page.
    Cambridge prefers this method because it clearly separates content from
    presentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Advantages of external CSS include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Consistent design across multiple pages</li>
    <li>Easier maintenance and editing</li>
    <li>Cleaner HTML code</li>
    <li>Better exam practice</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Using inline CSS or embedded CSS when external CSS is requested may result
    in lost marks.
  </p>

  <h3>15. Colour Choice and Contrast</h3>
  <p>
    Colour choice affects both usability and accessibility. Text should always
    be clearly visible against its background.
  </p>

  <p>
    Poor colour contrast makes content difficult to read and can disadvantage
    users with visual impairments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good practice includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dark text on a light background</li>
    <li>Avoiding bright or clashing colours</li>
    <li>Using consistent colour themes</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>16. Accessibility in Web Design</h3>
  <p>
    Accessibility means designing web pages so that all users, including those
    with disabilities, can access and understand the content.
  </p>

  <p>
    Accessibility features that are commonly tested include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Alternative text for images</li>
    <li>Clear and simple navigation</li>
    <li>Readable font sizes</li>
    <li>Logical page structure using headings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In theory questions, students should always mention accessibility when
    discussing good website design.
  </p>

  <h3>17. Target Audience and Purpose</h3>
  <p>
    When designing a website, it is important to consider the target audience.
    The design, language, and layout should suit the intended users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A school website should use clear language and formal design</li>
    <li>A children’s website should use bright colours and simple navigation</li>
    <li>A business website should appear professional and organised</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cambridge examiners often ask students to explain how a website design is
    suitable for a particular audience.
  </p>

  <h3>18. Examiner Keywords You Should Use</h3>
  <p>
    When answering theory questions, using correct terminology helps to gain
    full marks. Common examiner keywords include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Usability</li>
    <li>Accessibility</li>
    <li>Consistency</li>
    <li>Navigation</li>
    <li>Target audience</li>
    <li>Purpose</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Including these terms in your answers shows clear understanding of web
    authoring concepts.
  </p>
  <h3>19. Using Tables in Webpages</h3>
  <p>
    Tables are used to display data in rows and columns. In Cambridge IGCSE ICT,
    tables are commonly used for timetables, price lists, and comparison data.
  </p>

  <p>
    A basic table structure includes the following elements:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>&lt;table&gt;</strong> – defines the table</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;tr&gt;</strong> – table row</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;th&gt;</strong> – table heading</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;td&gt;</strong> – table data</li>
  </ul>

  <pre>
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Day&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Subject&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Monday&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ICT&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    Tables should be used only for displaying data, not for page layout.
  </p>

  <h3>20. Introduction to Forms (Theory Level)</h3>
  <p>
    Forms are used to collect user input. In IGCSE ICT, students are usually
    tested on understanding form elements rather than processing data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Common form elements include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Text boxes</li>
    <li>Radio buttons</li>
    <li>Checkboxes</li>
    <li>Drop-down lists</li>
    <li>Submit buttons</li>
  </ul>

  <pre>
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text"&gt;

  &lt;input type="submit" value="Send"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    Students should remember that forms in IGCSE ICT are mainly for structure
    and design, not for advanced scripting.
  </p>

  <h3>21. Image File Formats and Optimisation</h3>
  <p>
    Choosing the correct image file format is important for quality and file
    size. Cambridge expects students to understand common image formats.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>JPEG (.jpg)</strong> – best for photographs</li>
    <li><strong>PNG (.png)</strong> – best for logos and transparent images</li>
    <li><strong>GIF (.gif)</strong> – simple animations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Large image files can slow down a website. Images should be resized and
    compressed before being used on a webpage.
  </p>

  <h3>22. Image Size and Proportions</h3>
  <p>
    Images should not be stretched or distorted. Changing image size should
    maintain the original proportions to avoid poor appearance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Incorrectly resized images are a common practical exam mistake.
  </p>

  <h3>23. Validating and Checking HTML</h3>
  <p>
    Validation is the process of checking HTML code for errors. Valid code
    ensures that webpages display correctly across different browsers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before submitting work in an exam, students should:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Check for missing closing tags</li>
    <li>Ensure correct nesting of elements</li>
    <li>Check spelling of file names and links</li>
    <li>Confirm CSS is linked correctly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Validation helps prevent simple errors that can cost marks.
  </p>

  <h3>24. Final Exam Advice for Web Authoring</h3>
  <p>
    In practical examinations, always read the question carefully and follow
    client instructions exactly. Marks are awarded for accuracy rather than
    creativity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Key reminders:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use external CSS when required</li>
    <li>Include alternative text for images</li>
    <li>Check file names and paths carefully</li>
    <li>Test all links before submission</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Careful checking and calm execution are essential for success in Web
    Authoring tasks.
  </p>
  <h3>25. Summary of Web Authoring Concepts</h3>
  <p>
    Web authoring involves designing and creating webpages that are structured,
    visually clear, accessible, and suitable for their intended purpose. In
    Cambridge IGCSE ICT, students are expected to demonstrate both theoretical
    understanding and practical skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this section, you have learned how HTML is used to structure a
    webpage and how CSS is used to control its appearance. You have also learned
    the importance of usability, accessibility, and careful testing.
  </p>

  <h3>26. Web Authoring Revision Checklist</h3>
  <p>
    Before an examination or practical test, use the following checklist to
    ensure you are fully prepared:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>I can create a valid HTML page with correct structure</li>
    <li>I can link an external CSS file correctly</li>
    <li>I can use headings, paragraphs, lists, and images</li>
    <li>I can create working hyperlinks and navigation menus</li>
    <li>I understand relative file paths</li>
    <li>I include alternative text for all images</li>
    <li>I choose suitable colours and fonts</li>
    <li>I test my webpage before submission</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>27. Common Theory Question Patterns</h3>
  <p>
    Cambridge theory questions often ask students to explain or justify design
    choices. Typical question formats include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Explain why a webpage is suitable for a given audience</li>
    <li>Describe how accessibility has been considered</li>
    <li>State reasons for using external CSS</li>
    <li>Identify improvements to a poorly designed webpage</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When answering these questions, always use correct terminology and relate
    your answers to usability and accessibility.
  </p>

  <h3>28. High-Value Exam Keywords</h3>
  <p>
    Using appropriate technical terms helps examiners recognise understanding.
    Important keywords for Web Authoring include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Structure</li>
    <li>Consistency</li>
    <li>Navigation</li>
    <li>Accessibility</li>
    <li>Usability</li>
    <li>Target audience</li>
    <li>Purpose</li>
    <li>Validation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>29. Final Advice for Students</h3>
  <p>
    In Web Authoring tasks, accuracy is more important than creativity. Always
    read instructions carefully and follow them exactly. Small errors such as
    missing files, incorrect paths, or missing alternative text can result in
    lost marks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stay calm, work methodically, and test your work thoroughly before
    submission. These habits greatly improve performance in practical
    examinations.
