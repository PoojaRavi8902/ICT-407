  <h2>Student Pane – Web Authoring (IGCSE ICT)</h2>

  <h3>1. What is Web Authoring?</h3>
  <p>
    Web authoring is the process of designing and creating web pages that can be
    viewed using a web browser. In Cambridge IGCSE ICT, web authoring focuses on
    creating structured, well-designed, and accessible web pages using
    <strong>HTML</strong> for structure and <strong>CSS</strong> for presentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Students are assessed on their ability to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create valid HTML pages</li>
    <li>Apply external CSS stylesheets</li>
    <li>Use images, links, and navigation correctly</li>
    <li>Design pages suitable for a target audience</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Basic Structure of an HTML Webpage</h3>
  <p>
    Every HTML webpage must follow a clear structure. This structure helps
    browsers understand how to display the page and helps developers maintain
    the content easily.
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My Webpage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    The <strong>DOCTYPE</strong> declaration tells the browser that this page is
    written in HTML5. Missing or incorrect structure can lead to lost marks in
    practical examinations.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Common HTML Elements You Must Know</h3>
  <p>
    The following elements are frequently tested in both theory and practical
    examinations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</strong> – headings</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> – paragraphs</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;br&gt;</strong> – line breaks</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;</strong> – lists</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> – hyperlinks</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> – images</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Using Images Correctly</h3>
  <p>
    Images are added using the <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> tag. Every image must
    include alternative text using the <strong>alt</strong> attribute. This is
    essential for accessibility and is required for full marks.
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;img src="images/school.jpg" alt="Front view of the school building"&gt;
  </pre>

  <h3>5. Introduction to CSS</h3>
  <p>
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the appearance of a webpage. Cambridge
    IGCSE prefers the use of <strong>external CSS</strong> because it separates
    content from presentation and demonstrates good design practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    An external CSS file is linked using the following line inside the
    <strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong> section:
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
  </pre>

  <h3>6. Accessibility and Usability</h3>
  <p>
    A good webpage must be accessible to all users. This includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Clear navigation</li>
    <li>Readable font sizes</li>
    <li>Good colour contrast</li>
    <li>Alternative text for images</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Accessibility and usability are common theory questions in examinations.
  </p>

</section>

  </p>
    <h3>7. Hyperlinks and Navigation</h3>
  <p>
    Hyperlinks allow users to move between pages and sections of a website.
    In the Cambridge IGCSE ICT practical exam, students are often required to
    create navigation menus that link multiple pages together.
  </p>

  <p>
    A hyperlink is created using the <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> tag:
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    Links can also point to sections on the same page using IDs:
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;a href="#practice"&gt;Go to Practice Pane&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    Incorrect file paths are one of the most common reasons students lose marks
    in practical examinations.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Relative File Paths (Very Important)</h3>
  <p>
    A relative file path describes the location of a file in relation to the
    current file. Cambridge practical exams expect students to use relative
    paths correctly.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>style.css</strong> – file in the same folder</li>
    <li><strong>images/logo.png</strong> – image inside an images folder</li>
    <li><strong>../index.html</strong> – file one folder above</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Using incorrect paths will result in broken images or links, which leads
    to lost marks.
  </p>

  <h3>9. Using Lists Effectively</h3>
  <p>
    Lists are commonly used for navigation menus, instructions, and features.
    There are two main types of lists:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Unordered lists (<strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong>)</li>
    <li>Ordered lists (<strong>&lt;ol&gt;</strong>)</li>
  </ul>

  <pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  </pre>

  <h3>10. Good Page Layout and Consistency</h3>
  <p>
    A professional website uses a consistent layout across all pages. This
    means the header, navigation bar, and footer should appear in the same
    position on every page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consistency improves usability and is often mentioned in theory questions.
  </p>

  <h3>11. Testing a Webpage</h3>
  <p>
    Before submitting a webpage in an exam, students should always test their
    work carefully.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Check that all links work correctly</li>
    <li>Ensure images display properly</li>
    <li>Confirm CSS is linked correctly</li>
    <li>Check spelling and grammar</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Testing is an essential step and should be mentioned when answering theory
    questions about website development.
  </p>

  <h3>12. Common Exam Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Missing alternative text for images</li>
    <li>Incorrect file or folder names</li>
    <li>Using inline CSS instead of external CSS</li>
    <li>Poor colour contrast</li>
    <li>Ignoring client requirements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Avoiding these mistakes can significantly improve exam performance.
  </p>
  <h3>13. CSS Properties Commonly Tested in Exams</h3>
  <p>
    In Cambridge IGCSE ICT examinations, students are not expected to memorise
    every CSS property. However, there are several properties that appear
    frequently in both theory and practical tasks.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>color</strong> – sets the text colour</li>
    <li><strong>background-color</strong> – sets the background colour</li>
    <li><strong>font-family</strong> – changes the font type</li>
    <li><strong>font-size</strong> – changes the size of text</li>
    <li><strong>text-align</strong> – aligns text (left, center, right)</li>
    <li><strong>padding</strong> – space inside an element</li>
    <li><strong>margin</strong> – space outside an element</li>
  </ul>

  <pre>
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f4f6f8;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  text-align: center;
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    Using these properties correctly helps create a clear and professional
    layout and demonstrates good design practice.
  </p>

  <h3>14. Why External CSS Is Preferred</h3>
  <p>
    External CSS is written in a separate file and linked to the HTML page.
    Cambridge prefers this method because it clearly separates content from
    presentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Advantages of external CSS include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Consistent design across multiple pages</li>
    <li>Easier maintenance and editing</li>
    <li>Cleaner HTML code</li>
    <li>Better exam practice</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Using inline CSS or embedded CSS when external CSS is requested may result
    in lost marks.
  </p>

  <h3>15. Colour Choice and Contrast</h3>
  <p>
    Colour choice affects both usability and accessibility. Text should always
    be clearly visible against its background.
  </p>

  <p>
    Poor colour contrast makes content difficult to read and can disadvantage
    users with visual impairments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good practice includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dark text on a light background</li>
    <li>Avoiding bright or clashing colours</li>
    <li>Using consistent colour themes</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>16. Accessibility in Web Design</h3>
  <p>
    Accessibility means designing web pages so that all users, including those
    with disabilities, can access and understand the content.
  </p>

  <p>
    Accessibility features that are commonly tested include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Alternative text for images</li>
    <li>Clear and simple navigation</li>
    <li>Readable font sizes</li>
    <li>Logical page structure using headings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In theory questions, students should always mention accessibility when
    discussing good website design.
  </p>

  <h3>17. Target Audience and Purpose</h3>
  <p>
    When designing a website, it is important to consider the target audience.
    The design, language, and layout should suit the intended users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A school website should use clear language and formal design</li>
    <li>A children’s website should use bright colours and simple navigation</li>
    <li>A business website should appear professional and organised</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cambridge examiners often ask students to explain how a website design is
    suitable for a particular audience.
  </p>

  <h3>18. Examiner Keywords You Should Use</h3>
  <p>
    When answering theory questions, using correct terminology helps to gain
    full marks. Common examiner keywords include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Usability</li>
    <li>Accessibility</li>
    <li>Consistency</li>
    <li>Navigation</li>
    <li>Target audience</li>
    <li>Purpose</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Including these terms in your answers shows clear understanding of web
    authoring concepts.
