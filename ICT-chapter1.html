    <div class="note">
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <p>Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system. These are tangible parts you can touch and see. Hardware can be classified into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internal Components:</strong> CPU (Central Processing Unit), processor, motherboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Memory:</strong> RAM (Random Access Memory) – volatile memory used for temporary data storage while processing, ROM (Read-Only Memory) – non-volatile memory storing permanent instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Expansion Cards:</strong> Graphics card, Sound card, Network Interface Card (NIC).</li>
            <li><strong>Input/Output Devices:</strong> Devices for entering data (keyboard, mouse, scanner) and receiving output (monitor, printer, speakers).</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Devices:</strong> Internal storage (HDD, SSD), external storage (USB drives, external HDDs).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>Software is a set of programs that control the operations of a computer and allow users to perform specific tasks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Applications Software:</strong> Helps users complete tasks. Examples include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Word processing (Microsoft Word)</li>
                <li>Spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel)</li>
                <li>Databases (Microsoft Access)</li>
                <li>Control & measurement software</li>
                <li>Graphics, video, and audio editing software</li>
                <li>CAD (Computer Aided Design) applications</li>
                <li>Mobile apps and applets</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Allows the computer hardware to function and provides a platform for applications. Examples include:</li>

        <p><strong>Digital Data:</strong> Discrete signals using binary code (0s and 1s) to represent information.</p>
        <p>Computers require:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conversion of analogue → digital for processing</li>
            <li>Conversion of digital → analogue to control devices (e.g., speakers, motors)</li>
